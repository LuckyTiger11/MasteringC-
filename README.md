# MasteringC++
This repository serves the purpose of tracking my personal progress in mastering the C++ programming language.

I am an average programmer. Have some experience on the languge already but I am revisiting fundamental concepts to create a solid base for my learning process. This repocitory is going to be public for anyone who would like suggest reading content or better ways to approach challenges I encounter. Please leave the negative comments and salty attitudes at the gym. 

I am currently utilizing the book "Practical C++ Programming by Steve Oualline".
